# Fork in the Outlet
 A generic mod manager. It puts files in a folder. **Be warned that it will delete that entire folder.**

 Create a config file for a game and get started, simple as that. Create mod packages that include the file to be transferred.

 Why did I make this? Because I switched to Linux and Vortex didn't work on it, and I wanted to play KH3 with mods again.
